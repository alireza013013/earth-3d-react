## Introduction

**Earth 3D React** is a project that uses React and Three.js to create an interactive 3D Earth visualization. This project demonstrates how to combine these two libraries to build stunning 3D graphics in React applications.

## Features

- **Custom Shaders**: Implements a unique shader for creating a glowing halo effect around the Earth.
- **Interactive 3D Globe**: Users can rotate and interact with the globe.
- **Triangular Meshes**: Adds dynamic triangular mesh elements for enhanced visual effects.
- **Built with Three.js**: Utilizes Three.js for 3D rendering and visual effects.
- **React Integration**: Leverages React's component-based architecture for organized and maintainable code.
